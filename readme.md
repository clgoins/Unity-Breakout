## Unity Breakout

### What is it?
This is a simple reimagining of the classic Atari game, "Breakout".
This was created in Unity just for some practice with the engine, and
as practice for writing cleaner code using OOP concepts.

### How does it work?
The game can be launched by navigating to the build directory and
running `Breakout.exe`. You'll be greeted by a main menu, where you can
select "New Game". Use either the left & right arrow keys or "A" and "D"
keys to move.

### Why did I make this?
I've used Unity for a long time, and created more complex projects with it
than this, but I wanted to take a step back to the basics and practice writing
cleaner code in C#. I feel like I learned a lot from this project, and I
also feel like there's more to be learned, so I'll probably be doing some more
projects like this one in the future.
